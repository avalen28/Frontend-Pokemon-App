## Views ##
| View              | Route       | Description                             |
|----------------------|----------------|-----------------------------------------|

| Favorites     | /pokemon/favorites    | Get all favorite Pokemons (user's choice) |

## Notes üìù

- The main view ('/pokemon') makes an API call every time it renders. This decision was made because it's a quick and lightweight call, so it was simpler from a code perspective to make this call each time rather than making it once and storing it in local storage.

- I've chosen to create a utils folder to store methods that are repeated throughout the app, or that deal with logic that is not component-specific, aiming to keep the code organized.

- Since the aim of the project didn't include the creation of a database to store user favorite Pok√©mons, I've decided to store this information in the browser's local storage.

- About styles, I've made every effort to closely adhere to the provided requirements and replicate them faithfully.

- I've focused on creating components with reusability in mind.

## Improvements that could be made to the app üöÄ

- Work on using WebPack (Work in Progress)
- Refactor the API calls. Create a pok√©monService class that handles all the logic regarding the Pok√©Api, with various methods for each endpoint call, to remove such logic from the components.
- Adding a dynamic search feature that suggests matches as a name is entered into the search bar.
- Enhancing the user experience by improving the interface to include a "Pok√©mon Not Found" component style.
- Add more unit testing to achieve a higher code coverage.

It has really been a happy coding time! üíª
